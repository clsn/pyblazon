# File of lookup-charges for pyBlazon.
# Basically, if a charge isn't recognized, look here to see what it is.
#
# Basic case: name:    URL
# This is an <image> tag, the URL being a pointer to the raster image being
# included.  SVG images don't scale right just yet, 
# see http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=5560
#
# More fully: name:    URL tag otherstuff
# where the tag says what kind of object.  Currently the choices are:
# name:    URL IMAGE "transform"
# which is as above except you get to specify a transform.  Not generally
# needed, since you generally just want to use the picture.  Note that transform
# must be in double-quotes.
#
# name:    URL SVGpath "transform" fimbwidth
# This specifies something that is to be used with the <use> element in the SVG,
# as simply a path; the "ExtCharge" class in blazon.py.  Transform is much
# more important here, and must be in double-quotes.  fimbwidth is a number,
# the width of fimbriation (in internal-system units) (don't worry about it).
#
# expand to handle "Symbol" class?
#
# Most of these will come from http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projet:Blasons/Meubles
