Prerequisites for Initial Rollout:
(from arj letter 27 X 06)

- Other Features:
  - Lines of partition on bordures (YES BUT UGLY)

Vital:
- support all charges that are simple, geometrical figures (MOSTLY DONE)
- a charge or a group "between" a group (STARTING ON THIS)
- charges to end up in the conventional places according to divisions of the
  field. E.g. two annulets on a field parted per bend is supposed to go in
  the sinister chief and dexter base, not (by default) per fess. (MOSTLY
  DONE)

Fairly important:
- importing charges from file or database (it would get tedious to specify
  the outline of, say, a lion, in the source code itself) (GETTING THERE)
  - Going to need some more powerful equipment for more general case.
  - Probably some half-intelligent DOM-based solution. -arj
    - I sure hope not -mes
- permit importing (referencing) of raster-graphic charges. (DONE)
- back-references ("of the first" (DONE), "as many" (DONE))
- possible to specify each quarter in a quartered shield individually
- thin black lines between everything (or at least the option of having it)
- Implemented special case with "a fesse embattled", and also implement
  counter-embattled (DONE, sorta)
- Compony (I have my doubts about this one --mes)


Wishlist:
- "Gules within a bordure or a chief argent." looks horrible (squashing the
  bordure makes it look very odd).
- semy of _anything_ (even crazy, complex things like "a
  cross-crosslet or between four bezants" (GETTING THERE)
- multilingual support (e.g. blazons in French, German, Norwegian ...)
- marshalling (quarterly, impaled, etc)
- support for other shield shapes
- support for using a flag instead of a shield

Bugs:
- "Argent six roundels azure each charged with an escutcheon or" makes the
  escutcheons too big.  Probably just a matter of adjusting the scaling
  factor on escutcheons, which may be too large in general.
- The kludge that makes "per bend or and sable a crescent and a goute
  counterchanged" work, in joining the crescent and the goute into a single
  chargegroup, is, well, a kludge.  And it does bad things with "argent an
  escutcheon gules between mullets vert" etc.
- Similarly, you can't say "ermine a roundel sable and a mullet gules in
  pale".  You have to put the "in pale" after the *first* part, and say
  "ermine a roundel sable in pale and a mullet gules", which is weird.
  Part of the same hack.
- Also related, "in chief" has to come after the charge, while blazons seem
  to have it before the charge more often.
- Stuff like "Or on a bend sable between a mullet and a roundel gules, a
  crescent argent" is going to be near impossible from a grammar
  standpoint, without putting some extra restrictions on use of
  conjunctions (maybe).  Even extended lookahead won't make it easy.  And
  "Sable on a fess argent between two lozenges or a roundel gules between
  an increscent and a decrescent azure" is even tougher.
